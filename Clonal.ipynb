    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. What is the inspiration behind the Clonal Selection Algorithm?**\n",
    "**A:** CSA is inspired by the clonal selection principle of the biological immune system, where B-cells are cloned and mutated to better recognize antigens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What type of problems is CSA used for?**\n",
    "**A:** CSA is used for optimization problems, particularly when the solution space is complex and non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What is the objective function in your code?**\n",
    "**A:** The objective function is `xÂ² - 4x + 4`, and the goal is to minimize its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Why do we use mutation in CSA?**\n",
    "**A:** Mutation introduces diversity and allows the algorithm to explore new parts of the solution space, helping to avoid local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is elitism in CSA?**\n",
    "**A:** Elitism is the process of selecting the best-performing individuals (solutions) to carry forward into the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How does CSA differ from Genetic Algorithm (GA)?**\n",
    "**A:** While both use selection and mutation, CSA doesn't involve crossover. It focuses more on cloning and mutating high-affinity solutions (like immune cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. What is the role of `np.clip()` in your mutation function?**\n",
    "**A:** It ensures mutated values stay within the defined lower and upper bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. How is the best solution determined?**\n",
    "**A:** By evaluating the fitness values and choosing the individual with the minimum value (since weâ€™re minimizing the objective function).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What happens if we increase the mutation rate too much?**\n",
    "**A:** It may introduce too much randomness, causing the algorithm to lose good solutions and slow down convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. What are the hyperparameters in CSA and their impact?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pop_size`: Number of solutions; more means better diversity but slower.\n",
    "* `mutation_rate`: Controls variability; too high can hurt performance.\n",
    "* `generations`: Number of iterations; more gives better chance of convergence.\n",
    "* `num_selected`: How many best individuals to clone and mutate.\n",
