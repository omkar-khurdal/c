    "### **Theory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates operations on **fuzzy sets**, which are a key concept in **fuzzy logic** and **fuzzy set theory**. Fuzzy sets are generalizations of classical sets where each element has a degree of membership between `0` (not a member) and `1` (fully a member), rather than just being in or out of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations used in the code are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Union** (`max` operation): The union of two fuzzy sets is defined by taking the **maximum** value of the corresponding elements from both sets. This represents the degree of membership in either set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intersection** (`min` operation): The intersection of two fuzzy sets is defined by taking the **minimum** value of the corresponding elements from both sets. This represents the degree of membership common to both sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complement**: The complement of a fuzzy set is calculated as `1 - value`. It represents the degree to which an element is not a member of the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Difference**: The difference between two fuzzy sets is typically computed as the **minimum** of an element in the first set and the complement of the corresponding element in the second set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cartesian Product**: The Cartesian product of two fuzzy sets `A` and `B` is a relation between the elements of `A` and `B`, represented by pairs of elements. The fuzzy value of each pair is calculated as the **minimum** of the corresponding values from `A` and `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Max-Min Composition**: This operation is used to combine relations, often in fuzzy inference systems. The **max-min composition** involves taking the **minimum** of corresponding relations and then selecting the **maximum** among them. This helps in combining the effects of different relations in a fuzzy system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are used in various applications of fuzzy logic, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fuzzy control systems**\n",
    "* **Fuzzy decision-making systems**\n",
    "* **Fuzzy inference systems (FIS)**\n",
    "* **Fuzzy clustering and pattern recognition**\n",
