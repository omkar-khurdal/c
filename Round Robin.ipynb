    "'''Let's break down the code and explain it step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Server Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Server:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, sid): self.sid, self.active = sid, 0\n",
    "    def handle(self): self.active += 1; print(f\"Server {self.sid} → handling request (Connections: {self.active})\")\n",
    "    def finish(self): self.active -= self.active > 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** The `Server` class models a server that handles incoming requests.\n",
    "* **Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `sid`: A unique identifier for the server (e.g., `sid = 0, 1, 2` for 3 servers).\n",
    "  * `active`: The number of active connections the server has. It is initialized to 0 (no active requests).\n",
    "* **Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `handle()`: Increases the `active` count (simulating the server handling a request) and prints the server's current active connection count.\n",
    "  * `finish()`: Decreases the `active` count by 1 (indicating the server finishes a request). The `self.active -= self.active > 0` line ensures that `active` doesn't go below 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. LoadBalancer Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class LoadBalancer:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, servers, algo): self.servers, self.algo, self.last = servers, algo, -1\n",
    "    def distribute(self):\n",
    "        if self.algo == \"round_robin\":\n",
    "            self.last = (self.last + 1) % len(self.servers)\n",
    "            s = self.servers[self.last]\n",
    "        else:\n",

    "        s.handle()\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** The `LoadBalancer` class is responsible for distributing incoming requests to the servers based on the selected load balancing algorithm.\n",
    "* **Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `servers`: A list of `Server` objects.\n",
    "  * `algo`: The algorithm used for distributing requests. It can be either \"round\\_robin\" or \"least\\_connections\".\n",
    "  * `last`: A variable to remember the last server used (for \"round\\_robin\").\n",
    "* **Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `distribute()`: This method distributes an incoming request to a server based on the chosen algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Round Robin:** The requests are distributed in a circular manner. It tracks which server was last used and moves to the next one.\n",
    "    * **Least Connections:** The request is distributed to the server with the fewest active connections (`min(self.servers, key=lambda x: x.active)`).\n",
    "    * After distributing the request, the `handle()` method of the chosen server is called to simulate the server handling the request.\n",
    "  * `finish_requests()`: This method simulates the completion of requests on all servers. It calls `finish()` on all servers that have active connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Simulate Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def simulate(algo, n=9):\n",
    "    print(f\"\\n Simulation: {algo.replace('_', ' ').title()} Load Balancing\\n\")\n",
    "    lb = LoadBalancer([Server(i) for i in range(3)], algo)\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        print(f\"\\nIncoming Request {i+1}\"); lb.distribute(); time.sleep(0.4)\n",
    "        if i % 3 == 2: print(\"\\n Simulating request completion...\"); lb.finish_requests()\n",
    "    print(\"\\n Final server states:\"); [print(f\"Server {s.sid} active connections: {s.active}\") for s in lb.servers]\n",
    "    print(\"-\" * 40)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** This function simulates the behavior of the load balancer with a given algorithm and a specified number of incoming requests (`n`, default is 9).\n",
    "* **Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It initializes a `LoadBalancer` object with 3 servers and the chosen algorithm (`algo`).\n",
    "  * Then, for each incoming request (loop runs `n` times), it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Prints an incoming request message.\n",
    "    * Distributes the request using the `distribute()` method of the load balancer.\n",
    "    * Pauses for 0.4 seconds (`time.sleep(0.4)`) to simulate some delay between requests.\n",
    "    * Every 3rd request (when `i % 3 == 2`), it simulates the completion of requests on all servers using `finish_requests()`.\n",
    "  * After all the requests are processed, it prints the final state of each server (i.e., how many active connections each server has).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Main Block:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"==> Starting Round Robin Simulation\")\n",
    "    simulate(\"round_robin\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"==> Starting Least Connections Simulation\")\n",
    "    simulate(\"least_connections\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** This block runs the simulation twice: once using the **Round Robin** algorithm and once using the **Least Connections** algorithm.\n",
    "* **Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It first runs the `simulate()` function with the \"round\\_robin\" algorithm.\n",
    "  * Then, it runs the same function again with the \"least\\_connections\" algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What happens when you run this code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The simulation starts by using the **Round Robin** algorithm to distribute requests to the servers. Each incoming request is assigned to the next server in a circular manner.\n",
    "2. After every 3rd request, the simulation simulates the completion of requests (i.e., servers finish handling requests).\n",
    "3. Once all requests are handled, the program prints out the final active connection count for each server.\n",
    "4. The simulation is then repeated using the **Least Connections** algorithm, where requests are assigned to the server with the fewest active connections.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Theory Behind the Load Balancing Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Round Robin (RR):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Concept:** Round Robin is a simple algorithm where requests are distributed to servers in a circular order. The first request goes to the first server, the second to the second server, and so on. After the last server, the first server is selected again.\n",
    "   * **Advantages:** It is simple and ensures each server gets an equal number of requests.\n",
    "   * **Disadvantages:** It does not consider the current load on the servers (active connections). As a result, some servers may become overloaded while others may remain idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Least Connections (LC):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Concept:** The Least Connections algorithm assigns each new request to the server with the fewest active connections. This helps ensure that servers with less load handle new requests.\n",
    "   * **Advantages:** It dynamically adjusts to the load on each server, making it more efficient in handling varying request loads.\n",
    "   * **Disadvantages:** It may require more computational resources to track the number of active connections on each server.\n",
