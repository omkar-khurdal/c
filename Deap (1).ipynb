    "### **Genetic Algorithm (GA) - Theory Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are search heuristics inspired by the process of natural selection and genetics. GAs are a class of optimization algorithms used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. They work by mimicking the process of evolution, where solutions (individuals) evolve over generations, with each generation trying to improve based on certain selection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts in GA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A set of potential solutions (individuals).\n",
    "   * Each individual is represented by a **chromosome** (e.g., a list of numbers, binary values).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fitness Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This evaluates how \"good\" a solution (individual) is. The higher the fitness, the better the individual. In your example, the fitness function is the **sum of the bits** in a binary chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * This process selects individuals from the population based on their fitness to be parents for the next generation.\n",
    "   * **Tournament selection** is used, where a set of individuals is chosen randomly, and the one with the highest fitness is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crossover (Recombination)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A genetic operator that combines two parent individuals to create offspring.\n",
    "   * In your code, **two-point crossover** is used, which selects two points in the parent chromosomes and swaps segments between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mutation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Introduces small random changes in the offspring to maintain genetic diversity.\n",
    "   * **Bit-flip mutation** randomly flips bits (from 0 to 1 or vice versa) in the chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Replacement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * After offspring are generated through crossover and mutation, they replace some or all of the individuals in the population.\n",
    "   * In your example, the **best individuals** are replaced with mutated individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Termination Condition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The algorithm stops when a set number of generations (`ngen`) have passed, or when a satisfactory solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps in the GA Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A population of individuals (solutions) is created randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The fitness of each individual is evaluated using the fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selection**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Individuals are selected based on fitness to become parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crossover and Mutation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * New offspring are created by combining parents through crossover, and occasionally mutated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replacement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Offspring replace part or all of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The process repeats for a set number of generations, and the best solution is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Viva Questions on Genetic Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a Genetic Algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic used for optimization problems that simulates the process of natural evolution, using operations like selection, crossover, and mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explain the basic components of a Genetic Algorithm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The basic components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "     1. **Population**: A set of possible solutions.\n",
    "     2. **Fitness Function**: A function that evaluates the quality of each solution.\n",
    "     3. **Selection**: A method for selecting individuals to create offspring.\n",
    "     4. **Crossover**: A genetic operator that combines two parent solutions to create new offspring.\n",
    "     5. **Mutation**: A genetic operator that introduces random changes in the offspring to maintain diversity.\n",
    "     6. **Replacement**: A method for updating the population with new offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the selection methods in Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Common selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Roulette Wheel Selection**\n",
    "     * **Tournament Selection** (used in your code)\n",
    "     * **Rank Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the role of crossover in Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Crossover combines parts of two parent solutions to generate new offspring, promoting the exchange of genetic material to explore the search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Why is mutation important in Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Mutation introduces random changes in the offspring, helping the algorithm avoid local optima and maintain genetic diversity in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the termination condition in Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The algorithm stops after a set number of generations or when the solution reaches a satisfactory level of fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is a fitness function in the context of Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The fitness function evaluates how good a solution is relative to the problem being solved. The higher the fitness, the better the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How does a Genetic Algorithm differ from other optimization algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Genetic Algorithms are population-based and stochastic, meaning they explore a wider search space by evolving multiple solutions over time. They differ from gradient-based algorithms like Gradient Descent, which are deterministic and often rely on the smoothness of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Explain the crossover operator with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Crossover combines parts of two parent solutions. For example, with two binary strings `10101` and `11100`, a two-point crossover might swap the middle segments to produce two new offspring, such as `11101` and `10100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is elitism in Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elitism ensures that the best individuals from one generation are carried over to the next generation, preserving the best solutions found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Can handle complex and non-linear problems.\n",
    "  * Suitable for large and unknown search spaces.\n",
    "  * Robust and flexible.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Computationally expensive.\n",
    "  * May require fine-tuning of parameters.\n",
    "  * Prone to premature convergence if not properly managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **What are the common variations of Genetic Algorithms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Genetic Programming (GP)**: Evolving computer programs.\n",
    "  * **Differential Evolution (DE)**: A variant with a focus on continuous optimization.\n",
    "  * **Evolutionary Strategies (ES)**: Focuses more on self-adaptation of mutation.\n",
